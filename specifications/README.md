# Project Specifications

This directory contains specification documents (.mdc files) that define the development standards, guidelines, and best practices for The Lab project.

## Purpose

The specifications serve as:
- **Reference documentation** for developers working on the project
- **Onboarding material** for new team members
- **Quality standards** for code reviews
- **Decision records** for architectural choices

## Documents

### [development-standards.mdc](./development-standards.mdc)
Core development standards covering:
- JavaScript ES6+ specifications
- Data loading and API communication patterns
- Responsive design requirements
- Separation of concerns principles
- CSS organization standards
- Security best practices
- Code hygiene guidelines
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility requirements
- Documentation standards

## Using These Specifications

1. **Before Starting Work** - Review relevant sections to understand requirements
2. **During Development** - Reference as needed to ensure compliance
3. **During Code Review** - Use as criteria for evaluating changes
4. **When In Doubt** - Consult the specs or propose updates

## Contributing to Specifications

These documents are living standards that should evolve with the project:

- Propose changes via pull requests
- Document the reasoning for modifications
- Discuss major changes with the team
- Update version numbers and dates when modified

## File Format

We use `.mdc` (Markdown Component) files for specifications because they:
- Are human-readable and easy to edit
- Support rich formatting with markdown
- Can be version controlled effectively
- Work well with documentation tools
